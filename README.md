# PcgRandom: A RNG for JavaScript based on the PCG algorithm.

For information on the algorithm, see [here](http://www.pcg-random.org/).

This implementation is based on the [Minimal C Edition](https://github.com/imneme/pcg-c-basic). Most of the complexity in the code here comes from JavaScript's lack of 64 bit arithmetic support, which is required by the algorithm.

I'm unlikely to do the more complex RNGs in the non-minimal implentations, (or even implement the [pcg32x2 demo](https://github.com/imneme/pcg-c-basic/blob/master/pcg32-demo.c)) for the same reason. 64 bit arithmetic in JavaScript is tedious, and it gets worse as the bit width increases. Using arbitrary precision numbers might be possible, but not at an acceptable level of performance.

## Documentation

This library is usable as a common.js module (in something like node or browserify), or directly in the browser. In the browser, it adds a global `PcgRandom` identifier to window. When used as a common.js module, it simply exports `PcgRandom`.

### `new PcgRandom(...)`

PcgRandom's construction takes 4 arguments, all optional.

- `new PcgRandom(seedHi, seedLo, incHi, incLo)`
    + `seedHi`: The high 32 bits of the seed.
    + `seedLo`: The how 32 bits of the seed.
    + `incHi`: The high 32 bits of the incrementer.
    + `incLo`: The how 32 bits of the incrementer.

- `new PcgRandom(seedHi, seedLo, inc)`
    + `seedHi`: The high 32 bits of the seed.
    + `seedLo`: The low 32 bits of the seed.
    + `inc`: The low 32 bits of the incrementer (0 is used for high 32 bits).

- `new PcgRandom(seedHi, seedLo)`
    + `seedHi`: The high 32 bits of the seed.
    + `seedLo`: The low 32 bits of the seed.
    + The default incrementer value of 0x14057b7ef767814f is used.

- `new PcgRandom(seed)`
    - `seed`: The low 32 bits of the seed (0 is used for high 32 bits).
    - The default incrementer value of `0x14057b7ef767814f` is used. (`0x14057b7e` in the high 32 bits, and `0xf767814f` in the lower 32 bits).

- `new PcgRandom()`
    - The low 32 bits of the seed are randomly generated using `Math.random()`.
    - The default incrementer value of `0x14057b7ef767814f` is used. (`0x14057b7e` in the high 32 bits, and `0xf767814f` in the lower 32 bits).

Usage example:

```javascript
window.random = new PcgRandom(Date.now());
// initialize later using setSeed or setState, or leave with the seed based on the current time.
```

### `PcgRandom.prototype.setSeed(...)`

Seed the PcgRandom and optionally change the value of its incrementer.

The arguments to this method are the same as for the constructor, with the only difference that if no value is provided for the incrementer, it remains the same as it did prior to calling `PcgRandom.prototype.setSeed` (instead of reverting to the default incrementer value).

- `somePcgRandom.setSeed(seedHi, seedLo, incHi, incLo)`
    + `seedHi`: The high 32 bits of the seed.
    + `seedLo`: The how 32 bits of the seed.
    + `incHi`: The high 32 bits of the incrementer.
    + `incLo`: The how 32 bits of the incrementer.

- `somePcgRandom.setSeed(seedHi, seedLo, inc)`
    + `seedHi`: The high 32 bits of the seed.
    + `seedLo`: The low 32 bits of the seed.
    + `inc`: The low 32 bits of the incrementer (0 is used for high 32 bits).

- `somePcgRandom.setSeed(seedHi, seedLo)`
    + `seedHi`: The high 32 bits of the seed.
    + `seedLo`: The low 32 bits of the seed.

- `somePcgRandom.setSeed(seed)`
    - `seed`: The low 32 bits of the seed (0 is used for high 32 bits).
    - The incrementer is left unchanged.

- `somePcgRandom.setSeed()`
    - The low 32 bits of the seed are randomly generated using `Math.random()`.
    - The incrementer is left unchanged.

Usage example:

```javascript
var random = new PcgRandom(5000);
var n = random.integer(40);
// ... later
random.setSeed(5000); // revert seed so that we'll get the same sequence.
console.assert(n === random.integer(40));
```

### `PcgRandom.prototype.getState()`, `PcgRandom.prototype.setState(state)`

`getState` returns a copy of the internal state of this random number generator as a JavaScript Array. It takes no arguments.

`setState` takes a single argument,

This is provided so that you can save your random number generator's state when your program is not running.

Takes no arguments.

Usage example:

```javascript
function GameState() {
	this.rng = new PcgRandom();
	// ...
}

// used to save
GameState.prototype.toJSON = function() {
	return {
		rngState: this.rng.getState();
		// ...
	};
};

// used to load from a save
GameState.prototype.fromJSON = function(json) {
	this.rng.setState(json.rngState);
	// ...
};
```

### `PcgRandom.prototype.integer([max])`

Get a uniformly distributed 32 bit integer between 0 (inclusive) and a specified value (exclusive).

If the maximum value isn't specified, the function will return a uniformly distributed 32 bit integer, with no maximum.

Usage example:

```javascript
var random = new PcgRandom();

var someInts = new Array(50);
for (var i = 0; i < someInts.length; ++i) {
	someInts[i] = random.integer(40);
}
```


### `PcgRandom.prototype.number()`

Get a uniformly distributed IEEE-754 double between 0.0 and 1.0, with 53 bits of precision (every bit of the mantissa is randomized)

Usage example:

```javascript

var random = new PcgRandom();

// force everybody to use my RNG, even if they call `Math.random()` (Note: this is a bad idea).
Math.random = function() {
	return random.number();
};

```

## Caveats

It's worth noting that this isn't a cryptographically secure PRNG. If you need one, keep looking.
